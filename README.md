# portfolio-homework
For this assignment I created a portfolio to show that I am capable of creating a portfolio page from scratch.  Every line of code was written exclusively by me in order to display that I have acquired the skills needed to create this site one my own without having to copy and paste generic code.  It was difficult but enjoyable. I first attempted flex box, but later changed to grid.  I found it much easier to design my website once I learned the ability to control where my content went, in relation to the grids and rows. It appears now, but was my abilities approve over time, and my portfolio expands, the more I will be able to tailor this site to showcase my skills.
